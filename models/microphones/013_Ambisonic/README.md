# SOYUZ 013 Ambisonic – Frequency Response Data

The SOYUZ 013 Ambisonic is a spatial microphone system designed for ambisonic and immersive audio recording.

This microphone system uses four capsules with identical frequency response characteristics.  
This directory therefore provides a single relative frequency response curve applicable to all four capsules.

## Included files

- Frequency response curve (applies to all four capsules):
  - CSV (machine-readable)
  - PNG (visual reference)
- Model metadata (JSON)

## Measurement note

Frequency response data is provided for comparative and illustrative purposes only.

Measurements were performed using a consistent internal procedure under controlled conditions.
The detailed measurement methodology is proprietary and not disclosed.

Curves are smoothed and represent an averaged response.
